# Build a Buil Script

One common use of bash scripts is for releasing a “build” of your source code. Sometimes your private source code may contain developer resources or private information that you don’t want to release in the published version.

In this project, you’ll create a release script to copy certain files from a source directory into a build directory.

Start the script
1.
Take a look at the build and source folders. The objective of our script is to copy files from source to build, with a couple of exceptions and modifications.

Get started on the script by adding a header to script.sh, identifying the type of script.


2.
Let’s welcome the user to the script. Feel free to use your own style here.

Make sure to save your script. Test your script in the terminal using ./script.sh.


3.
Since we are creating a new build, let’s verify with the user that they have updated changelog.md with the current release version.

The first line of the file contains a version number with markdown formatting like so:

## 1.1.1
Read the first line of this file into a variable firstline. You can use the linux command head for this purpose.


4.
We want just the version number without the markdown formatting. The command read can be used to split a string into an array using the -a argument.

Split the string firstline into the array splitfirstline.

The syntax for splitting a string foo into an array bar is:

read -a bar <<< $foo


5.
Now we are ready to set the value of the version of the script. It is located in index 1 of the array splitfirstline.

The syntax for accessing the value at index of an array foo is:

${foo[index]}
Save the version to a variable, version.

Print a statement to the terminal notifying the user of the version they are building.


User Input
6.
Let’s give the user a chance to exit the script if they need to make a change to the version.

Ask the user to enter “1” (for yes) to continue and “0” (for no) to exit.

Assign their response to the variable versioncontinue.


7.
Add a conditional. If the user said “1” to the continue question, we will execute the rest of our script. For now, respond “OK”.

If the user did not, tell them “Please come back when you are ready”.


Copying files
8.
Now we want to copy every file from source to build except for secretinfo.md.

Within the positive conditional (where we told the user “OK”), start by iterating over all the files in the source directory and printing their names to the terminal.


9.
Check if the filename is “source/secretinfo.md”. If it is, inform the user that it is not being copied.

Otherwise, inform the user that it is being copied.

Make sure to use spaces in your string conditional.


10.
Now we can actually copy the files. After informing the user the file is being copied, copy the file into the build directory.

You can use the terminal to make sure the right files have been copied:

ls build/


Listing files
11.
The final thing we want to do is list the files in the build directory for the user.

Outside of the loop over the filenames in the directory, use the script to change the directory to the build directory. So that we don’t forget, also add the command to change back to the directory with the script.


12.
Add code to notify the user what files are currently in the build directory.

Be sure to reference the version in your message.

13.
You now have a build script for this repository. Feel free to play around with making it more robust. Some ideas:

Copy secretinfo.md but replace “42” with “XX”.
Give the script more character with emojis.
